            <p>It may not be immediately apparant since this is primarily a Digimon website, but I don't just visit
                Odaiba to take photographs of Taichi's apartment from fifty angles. Tokyo Bay is, bar none, my favourite
                place in the world. This is why I have not stopped at merely taking a photo or two of each place, but
                provided visitors with lots of information so you can come to appreciate it for more than just a
                background to an animated show.</p>

            <p>Odaiba is an anomaly in Tokyo, which is so crammed full of buildings and roads. Different, too, from
                Osaka, where I lived. It has both parkland and beach, boardwalks and ferris wheels, high-tech and
                laid-back. Its interesting history, or sometimes lack thereof, lend it a mysterious quality. The
                combination of these things is what causes me to love Odaiba, to spend hours just sitting in the parks
                or browsing the shopping street, watching the sun set from the bridge and the reflection of the bright
                lights on the water. Anyone who claims that Odaiba is not beautiful has never been there at night. It is
                a strange pocket of Tokyo where time appears to slowed.</p>

            <p>It's a little sad to me that many of the things that made Odaiba so alluring to me during the years I
                lived in Japan (2007-2010) are fading now. Odaiba is up and coming; still evolving - the "city of the
                future" was supposed to be completed in 2015 and is now seeing big changes in preparation for the 2020
                Olympics - though it certainly isn't doing so at the breakneck rate it did just prior to<i> Digimon
                    Adventure</i>. Just five years before the show, there weren't any high-rise apartment buldings or
                shopping centres in the area. It was concrete slabs and wharfs, nothing more; but the land was filled
                with construction sites that would become Searea, FujiTV, DECKS and the hotels. The area beyond Ariake
                Tennis-no-Mori was just a field. No one lived there, and the Yurikamome (1994) and Rinkai-sen (1996)
                trains only ferried visitors to the newly-completed Telecom Center and the port workers to their
                warehouses. A photograph on the South Promenade of the Rainbow Bridge depicts an Odaiba circa 1994 or
                so, the clusters of cranes and materials making it look more like the victim of a massive earthquake
                rather than the city of the future.</p>

                <p>(See the <a href="teleport.html" target="_blank">Tōkyō Teleport Town</a> section for more information
                    on the mid-90s development of the area.)</p>
            </center>
            <p>Yet within 5 years, it became the kind of place we saw in <i>Digimon</i>, the kind of neighbourhood where
                you could run to any of the other apartments in just a few moments, hide an enourmous winged Digimon in
                the middle of Tokyo, fit an entire town's population into a single building and keep them hostage.
                That's changed a little since the series ended. I'd like to know more about the lives of real people
                from Odaiba, because when I go there now, it is tourists as far as the eye can see.</p>

            <p>Some things do change, as cities like Tokyo are destined to swallow their empty spaces with time, no
                matter what objections are raised. Land is money in a city of so many people. The park full of flowers
                behind Fuji TV is now a parking lot, for example, and the Suntory building now blocks the view of
                Palette Town from Searea. Spots still marked "Construction Site" on maps around town now sport
                high-rises. The Yurikamome has been extended an additional 5 stops and the Rinkai line (known as the
                Rinkai-fukutoshin-sen until 2001) no longer terminates at Tokyo Teleport Station, continuing on past
                Tennozu to form a link with the other trains on the mainland. Aqua City, Diver City and Mediage have
                appeared and taken the area by storm, drawing more and more tourists every year. But even with all these
                people flowing into the area, it's still easy to find a quiet spot on the beach to sit and read or draw,
                or enjoy a rice ball uninterrupted in Daiba-koen, or get a window seat in one of the restaurants
                overlooking the bridge. In the late morning, when the couples have returned to Tokyo proper and the
                salarymen have headed to the offices, and workers to the docks, Odaiba is like a deserted island you may
                take for yourself. Even Takeuchi Naoko, the author of <i>Sailor Moon</i>, went to a hotel overlooking
                Tokyo Bay when she was nearing a deadline and needed focus and inspiration.</p>

            <p>But even if you only go as a fan, to see Tokyo Big Sight or the real-life Fuji TV, perhaps you can learn
                something about this place.</p>

            <p>Now the future is happening all around Odaiba. Recent visitors can still see the landmarks I photographed
                back in 2008, but they won't be seen from the same angles I did. Many of the photos I took at that time
                are no longer shootable. I'm glad I completed this project when I did, and I still look forward to my
                frequent visits back here. Maybe I can post a little more about Odaiba entering the 2020s, soon.</p>

            <hr>
            <P>I created this site in 2008, after I realized that I had taken so many photos of Odaiba that it would be
                a shame not to share them with other fans. The design of the site may look shabby, but it is
                deliberately meant to remind you of good old 1999. ;)</p>
            <P>I spent three years in Japan and many hours in Odaiba. I was also fortunate enough to attend the Digimon
                10th Anniversary Concert given by Wada Kouji, AiM, Hassy, Sammy, Tanimoto Takayoshi and Ohta Michihiko
                in Tokyo on August 1, 2009. What an amazing experience! It is the one thing that I was not able to
                photograph and share. I thought my heart was going to explode when AiM waved at me and smiled from the
                other side of the room as she was being escorted to her dressing room. There were very few foreigners in
                attendance, and I suppose I caught her eye.</p>
            <p>After the concert, my friends and I went out to the annual Digimon gathering in the park on Dai-san
                Daiba, and I pointed out landmarks such as Koushirou's apartment and the school as we walked. I had a
                lot of opportunities to watch it grow and change over my visits. Sad to say that by the time I go back,
                it may look nothing like it did in 2009, just as there are vast differences between the way things
                looked in '99 and '09. Still, it's nice to have an almost-record.</p>
            <P>I hope viewing <i>Odaiba Memorial</i> makes you think nostalgically about Digimon Adventure, and you get
                as much enjoyment out of the real-world Odaiba as I did!</p>
