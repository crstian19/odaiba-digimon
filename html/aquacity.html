                <p>The monsterous shopping complex known as Aqua City is located on the waterfront, across the street
                    from Fuji Terebi and next to DECKS Tōkyō Beach. It's built in the image of a Mediterranean village
                    and is painted in bright colours that make it very eye-catching from the water and the Daibas. Aqua
                    City has restaurants, bars and retail shops, 13 cinema complexes and a number of entertainment
                    attractions. Daiba Station is its closest access.</p>

                <p>Aqua City and the area around it (the Promenade Park) opened in April of 2000, almost a year after
                    the events of <i>Digimon Adventure</i>. Nevertheless, it appears in the series and is even mentioned
                    by name: the construction site in which Yamato and Gabumon hide with Hikari is the very one which
                    would eventually become Aqua City. The French Statue of Liberty, however, which had occupied a spot
                    near Fuji Terebi in April 1998, returned to France in early 1999 and is such not featured in
                    <i>Adventure</i>. A replica statue was erected in 2000.</p>
