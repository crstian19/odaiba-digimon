                <p>The DECKS Tokyo Beach building was one of the first shopping/entertainment centres built during the
                    revival of the Tokyo Bay area in 1996. Six stories high and containing the popular Odaiba Little
                    Hong Kong, the Odaiba Icchoume Shoutengai and Sega Joypolis, it offers one of the best sitting views
                    of the Rainbow Bridge. The name of the complex comes from the boardwalk on the north side of the
                    building, overlooking Odaiba-kaihinkōen. It is next door to Aqua City and connected by the
                    boardwalk.</p>

                </p>

                <p>On weekends and holidays, musicians and street performers can be found giving shows in the building,
                    primarily on the boardwalk. The closest Yurikamome station is Odaiba-kaihinkōen, but Daiba station
                    near Aqua City next door is also close.</p>

                <p>Though DECKS is not featured onscreen in <i>Digimon Adventure</i>, it does appear in <i>02</i>, in
                    episode 38, <i>Holy Night Digimon Ōshūgō.</i> Natsuko meets Oikawa on the complex's boardwalk.</p>
