                <p>Fuji Television Network, Inc. is a Japanese television network based in Odaiba, founded in 1951. It
                    is usually known as Fuji TV (pronounced Fuji Terebi) or CX. Its current slogan is "HAVE YOUR
                    MEASURE, because a chance is Fuji TV." (HAVE YOUR MEASURE, Kikkake wa Fuji Terebi.) The network was
                    a pioneer when it moved to Odaiba in 1997 and is famous for its eccentric design. The building is
                    said to be one of the most recognized and visited landmarks in Tokyo. Access it from Daiba Station.
                </p>

                <p>Fuji has aired hundreds of anime titles since its inception, including some of the most prolific
                    shows in history; <i>Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy), Sazae-san, Dragon Ball</i> and others.
                    Unfortunately, past anime works rarely feature as part of the building decor or studio tour, as
                    these are usually kept up-to-date with the latest shows on the network. Fuji also specializes in
                    dramas and variety shows, with a number of these as well as <i>tokusatsu</i>, news and sports
                    programs on the air.</p>

                    <i>.::At night, the </i>hachitama<i> is illuminated in various colours::.</i>
                </p>

                <p>Fuji TV also is certainly the most visible Odaiba landmark featured in <i>Digimon</i>. The workplace
                    of Takeru and Yamato's father Ishida Hiroaki, it is the scene of Wizarmon's death and in the battle
                    against Vamdemon, the building being torn to shreds as Vamdemon evolves, and ending at length when
                    WarGreymon and WereGarurumon kick the enormous "hachitama" (the ball containing the 25th-floor
                    observatory) into VenomVamdemon's stomach. </p>

                <p>Fuji returns in <i>02</i> as the setting for a ghost story near the end of the Digimon Kaiser arc.
                    Wizarmon's ghost haunts the rebuilt observatory, seeking to warn Tailmon about the prophecy
                    regarding the Crest of Kindness. </p>

                </p>

                <p>Other small nods to Fuji are contained in the show, such as the logo in the dashboard of the company
                    van Mr, Ishida drives, and Channel 8 is the station Yamato turns to when Odaiba is first cut off
                    from the rest of Tokyo by Vamdemon.</p>
