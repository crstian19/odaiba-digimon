                <p>In the years since <i>Digimon Adventure</i> initially aired, Odaiba has continued to grow and evolve
                    along with Tōkyō. As such, a few of the places pictured in the show have changed or disappeared
                    entirely. Many of these changes took place before this website was ever created, but I have
                    endeavoured to document some of them.</p>

                <p>At some point before 2007, the Passenger Terminal at Hinode recieved a makeover.</p>

                <p>And this irritating sign was put up right in front of a spot I wanted to photograph.</p>

                <p><a href="images/lost_03.jpg"><IMG SRC="images/t_lost_03.jpg" border=0></a></p>

                <p>I got in behind the the new sign and found the remnants of the old one.</p>

                <p>Just to add some insult to injury, the similar-design sign around the corner had disappeared
                    somewhere over a span of six months.</p>

                <p>Incidentally, the blue triangles that once served as the decor on the front of the Passenger Terminal
                    are still present on the back.</p>

                <p><b>Toei Jūnigō-sen</b><br>
                    <i>Toei Line #12</i>
                </p>

                <p>The Jūnigō-sen was a location that went under heavy re-imaging after its appearance in
                    <i>Adventure</i>. At the time it was the newest subway in Tōkyō and a project of massive scale.
                    Starting in the suburb of Hikarigaoka (so far northwest it actually borders Saitama Prefecture), it
                    ran as far as Shinjuku Station, a total of 12 stops. When the line first opened in 1991, it ran a
                    mere four stops from Hikarigaoka to Nerima. However, plans to revise the transport systems in Japan
                    are laid years, usually decades in advance. The official plan for the year 2000 opening of the
                    finalized Jūnigō-sen was orchestrated in 1972. (Though this map actually depicts the Jūnigō-sen
                    continuing PAST Hikarigaoka and heading west.)</p>

                <p>In 1991, most of the Tokyo government offices were relocated to Shinjuku, to the building that would
                    be showcased in <i>Digimon Tamers</i> as the Hypnos HQ. As such, the Jūnigō-sen was intended to link
                    the already-bustling Shinjuku area with all the other subway lines in the city, by forming a massive
                    loop that would connect at stations as far as Shiodome. When it was finally complete, the line was
                    renamed from <i>Toei Jūnigō-sen</i> (Toei Line #12) to <i>Toei Ōedo-sen</i> (Toei Oedo Line). The
                    Ōedo-sen in its current form is also depicted in early episodes of <i>Digimon Tamers</i>.</p>

                <p>The Ōedo-sen as it currently exists would have made transit from Hikarigaoka to Odaiba much faster
                    and easier than the then-Jūnigō-sen was during the time of <i>Digimon Adventure</i>. The show does
                    much to emphasize how far they are from home - essentially at the opposite end of the city, and with
                    little money. Koushirou's route is highlighted on the following metro map from 1999:

                <p><a href="images/subway1999.png"><IMG SRC="images/t_subway1999.png" border=0></a></p>

                <p><i>(Click for the fullsize version!)</i></p>

                <p>At the time, the trip would be minimum 50 minutes on the train [16 minutes on the Jūnigō-sen from
                    Hikarigaoka to Nakano-sakaue, 20 minutes on the Marunouchi-sen from Nakano-sakaue to Ginza, 2
                    minutes from Ginza to Shimbashi on the Ginza-sen, and 12 minutes from Shimbashi to Odaiba-kaihinkoen
                    via Yurikamome], and at least 4 minutes per station (much more for the changes at Nakano-sakaue and
                    Shimbashi) to switch platforms and wait to transfer to the next line. In reality a trip from
                    Hikarigaoka to Odaiba-kaihinkoen is plausible in about an hour but would probably take closer to
                    70-75 minutes. Now, however, the 12th subway line looks very different. Shiodome Station, with a
                    transfer to the Yurikamome line, was added in 2002. (For more info, see the <a
                        href="yurikamome.html" target="_blank">Yurikamome</a> page.) In its current incarnation (2009)
                    the trip from Hikarigaoka to Shiodome is possible in 42 minutes without a transfer, and from there
                    to Odaiba-kaihinkoen is just 11 minutes. Here is the metro map as it appeared in 2001, after the
                    opening of the Ōedo-sen:</p>

                <p>The Ōedo-sen is the purple line that begins in the top left hand corner (Hikarigaoka Station). </p>

                <p>Looking at the things around this sculpture, it ought to be at the bottom of the stairs in front of
                    Fuji TV, but it isn't, so...it may have been moved or taken down since the show's airing.</p>
