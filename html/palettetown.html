                <p>This shopping and entertainment complex consists of Venus Fort, Sun Walk, Mega Web, a ferris wheel
                    and Zepp Tōkyō, a large concert venue. The most well-known destination in Palette Town is Venus
                    Fort, a shopping mall designed in a 17th century European motif, complete with artificial sunsets
                    every 30 minutes. The Toyota Mega Web technology showcase is next door, along with the ferris wheel,
                    <i>Daikanransha</i>, and Leisureland, a giant 24-hour arcade. Access the area from Aomi Station.</p>

                <p>Palette Town opened to the public in 1999, the same year <i>Digimon Adventure</i> aired. It is first
                    seen right at the beginning of the Vamdemon arc, as when Taichi and Koromon initially return to
                    Japan after defeating Etemon in <i>"Koromon Tōkyō Daigekitotsu!"</i>, they are deposited on the
                    Promenade outside Palette Town. The <i>Daikanransha</i> is seen in the background in these early
                    scenes. Later in the arc, the final battle against VenomVamdemon takes place in Palette Town,
                    resulting in the destruction of the wheel, Venus Fort and other buildings that were not clearly
                    detailed in the show.</p>

                <p>The famous Odaiba ferris wheel, the <i>daikanransha</i> (literally "big ferris wheel"), held the
                    record of being the largest ferris wheel in the world when it was built (in 1999 with a diameter of
                    100 meters and standing 115 meters tall), and is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for
                    that year. It features mostly rainbow-coloured cars as well as a small number of glass-bottomed cars
                    for maximum view, and at night displays 16 different patterns with 120 different kinds of coloured
                    lights. Taking 16 minutes to do a full revolution, the ferris wheel is a popular couples spot, with
                    the colour of the car you ride in supposedly having some symbolism for your luck. Pink is the car to
                    ride in on a date! From the <i>daikanransha</i>, you can see the <i>Daiya to Hana</i> (Diamond and
                    Flower) 117 metre ferris wheel that resides in Kasai-Rinkai Kōen, half an hour's train ride away.

                <p>The wheel is <i>supposedly</i> visible from the Yagamis' living room (see the <a
                        href="contradictions.html">Contradictions</a> section for more info). It is often featured in
                    background scenes, until being destroyed by VenomVamdemon.</p>
