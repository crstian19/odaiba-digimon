                <p>The first season kept its characters' homes closely guarded secrets for the most part, with the
                    exception of the Yagami family. The only apartment shown more than once is Odaiba Mansion, the
                    complex where the Izumi and Kido familes both supposedly live. It appears briefly in
                    <i>Adventure</i> episode 31, <i>Raremon! Tōkyōwan Shūgeki</i>, as Koushirou and Tentomon sneak out
                    of the house to battle Raremon. At this time, Koushirou is shown leaving the complex and going
                    directly to the street. Later, as the Bakemon are breaking into the mansion and capturing all of the
                    families, the animators focus on the ground-floor unit that supposedly belongs to the Izumi family.
                </p>

                <p>In reality, there is no building in Odaiba called "Odaiba Mansion." (As noted elsewhere on the site,
                    a "mansion" or "manshon" is the Japanese term for an apartment building.) The complex where
                    Koushirou and Jou supposedly reside is actually the Searea Odaiba Sanbangai Icchoume Apartments
                    (roughly <i>Odaiba #3, First Block</i>) located next to Odaiba Rainbow-koen. It is not shown in
                    detail in the first season at all, but for observant viewers, the power sent to Imperialdramon by
                    Gennai in episode 39 of 02, <i>Zen'in Shutsudō! Imperialdramon</i>, explodes out of this building.
                    This is fairly consistent with the path Koushirou is shown running on the way to Taichi's house in
                    <i>Bokura no War Game!</i> and the way he leaves to get a cell phone - Searea Odaiba Sanbangai and
                    Searea Odaiba Gobangai, where the Yagamis live, are no more than five minutes walk apart. However,
                    the portrayal of the building is slightly inconsistent in that in <i>Adventure</i> episode 31 the
                    mansion appears to exit onto the street, whereas the real Sanbangai opens directly into Rainbow-koen
                    on the front.</p>

                <p>There is also some evidence that Takeru, Iori and Miyako live in this complex, though not in the
                    Icchoume Apartments, but rather Sanbangai Tomin Towers buildings. At first glance, Ichibangai seemed
                    like a stronger contender when this site first went live, but more recently I've changed my thinking
                    toward Sanbangai, thanks to hints given in episode 35, <i>Bakushin! BlackWargreymon</i>. While out
                    in front of the school after returning from the Digital World, Takeru says a hasty goodbye and runs
                    in the direction of the bridge, while Miyako follows, saying "But we live in the same mansion!" This
                    indicates that he is going in the wrong direction from their houses, which debunks my theory that
                    Takeru and company moved into Ichibangai during its completion between 1999 and 2002.</p>
                <p>Later in the episode, the Palette Town ferris wheel can be seen as a backdrop for Takeru's balcony,
                    reinforcing the theory.</p>
                <p>Initially, I thought that the convenience store that Miyako's family supposedly runs (AiMart in the
                    series) was probably the former 7-11 located in the Searea Odaiba Ichibangai 3rd Building Icchoume
                    Apartments (now the My Basket Daiba 1-Chome Shop, as of 2014-ish), the frontmost of the three
                    buildings beyond the school. However, the streetside building is only 5 floors, and the elevator
                    scene in the first episode as well as the balcony scene from episode 35 would probably have the
                    viewers believe that they in fact live in a higher tower than that. The kids are also seen
                    approaching the school from the south on numerous occasions. Thus, Sanbangai is the safest bet. The
                    very top of the building is visible in the Sora screenshot further down this page.</p>

                <p><i>Searea</i> was the name given to the first blocks of apartments built in Odaiba during its
                    revitalization plan in 1996. Searea Odaiba 5bangai (<i>Gobangai</i>) is located just a few steps
                    away from Odaiba-kaihinkoen Station and across the street (Shiria-mae Crossing, see the <a
                        href="kaihinkoen.html" target="_blank">Odaiba-kaihinkoen</a> section for more info) from Searea
                    Odaiba 3bangai (<i>Sanbangai</i>), where the Izumi and Kido families live.</p>

                <p>It may seem odd or too coincidental that nearly all of the Chosen live in the same building or very
                    nearby, but it's important to remember that Odaiba is a very small place, more like a little town in
                    the middle of a city. All the residences tend to be clustered near the train stations and
                    shopping/entertainment zones, and at the time, these were concentrated around Odaiba-kaihinkoen
                    Station. Maruetsu was the only grocery store on the island until as recently as 2007. In 1999 and
                    2000, during the airing of the first two seasons, I would estimate that about 90% of the population
                    of Odaiba was in the Kahinkoen area. Thus it is not at stretch at all to imagine so many of the
                    Chosen being in the Searea Gobangai complexes, a set of four buildings built on a raised platform
                    level with Odaiba-kaihinkoen station. The grocery store is located <i>under</i> the west complexes,
                    while the east complexes face the Shiria-mae pedestrian crossing destroyed by Ogremon and Koromon in
                    episode 21, <i>Koromon Tōkyō Daigekitotsu!</i></p>

                <p>The depiction of the Searea areas in the <i>Digimon</i> series appear to have been deliberately
                    vague. In <i>Adventure</i>, only the Yagami home was ever shown in detail, but in a way that made
                    the actual building of the four almost impossible to determine. See the <a href="yagami.html"
                        target="_blank">Yagami</a> section for photos and details on this. However, the writers would go
                    on to depict not just Taichi and Hikari but a minimum of <i>four</i> Chosen living in Searea
                    Gobangai apartments. This does involve some detective work, as once again it is never outwardly
                    stated.</p>

            <p><b>Sora</b> - Sora is depicted walking between the buildings at the very beginning of <i>Bokura no War
                    Game!</i> There is a strong possibility that she lives in one of them. However, <i>Bokura no War
                    Game!'s</i> depictions of the Searea buildings are not entirely consistent with those of the TV
                series, as usual.</p>

            <p><b>Yamato</b> - There is a good chance that Sora and Yamato live in the same building, if observations of
                Sora's home prove correct. Yamato and Taichi are shown meeting between two buildings that they seem to
                have just exited in 02 episode 7, <i>Hikari no Kioku</i>.</p>

            <p><b>Daisuke</b> - In the same scene of episode 7, while discussing going to Daisuke's house, Taichi and
                Yamato glance up at an adjacent building. Since it was established in another episode that Daisuke did
                live in a Gobangai complex, it is very likely that of the three Gobangai buildings closest to the
                station, Taichi, Yamato and Daisuke each reside in one. In episode 39 of 02, <i>Zen'in Shutsudō!
                    Imperialdramon</i>, as the three of them as well as Hikari are seen exiting the back stairs of the
                Gobangai complex en route to Koushirou's house.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Ichibangai is the block of Searea apartments located closest to the Rainbow Bridge. There are three
                    buildings in this block. It is not entirely consistent with its depiction in the series, as with
                    many of the other residences.</p>

                <p>Since Ichibangai is the only apartment block in the direction Mimi and her father leave the park from
                    (episode 35), there is a good chance that she lives here - even though it seems strange that her
                    father would walk through the park to get home. The park provides access only to the Icchoume
                    apartments, where the Izumi and Kido families live, but the fact that Koushirou and Jou's residences
                    were explicitly tied together in the show makes me fairly certain that Mimi cannot be in the same
                    building without it being mentioned. In <i>Digimon Adventure</i>, the two bigger towers of Searea
                    Ichibangai are depicted as being still under construction, as they were in 1999. Therefore, the
                    chances are good that Mimi lives in the building closest to the park, as I can't yet confirm whether
                    or not any of the other buildings had residences at the time. Sanbangai, where Koushirou and Jou
                    live, also is visible in this screenshot, on the right hand side.</p>
                <p><IMG SRC="images/t_kaihinkoen_06_d.png"></p>

                <p>The Tomin Towers (one one of which is visible above) would be completed by the time the buildings
                    were depicted in 02.</p>

                <p>Ichibangai is just a few steps from the school, visible in this screenshot to the left of the green
                    space (Rainbow-koen). Once again a case could be made that a staff member lives at Ichibangai, as
                    the <i>side</i> of the school seems like a closer match for the way the school building is drawn in
                    02.</p>

                <p>At first glance the Ichijouji residence seems like it might be the easiest of the Chosens' houses to
                    find, as in episode 8 of <i>02</i>, <i>Digimon Kaiser no Kodoku</I>, Koushirou helpfully provides
                    viewers with a map, while Hikari points out where on the map Ken's apartment would be. We are given
                    an exterior view AND an apartment number. Too good to be true, of course, as the map hardly
                    resembles Tamachi Station, or any other station in the area. Back to the drawing board!

                    essentially nothing about Takeru's home in <i>Adventure</i> is shown to viewers as he is only there
                    for a few seconds of screentime in episode 35. The flashback scenes of the Ishida family prior to
                    the divorce took place in <a href="hikarigaoka.html">Hikarigaoka</a>. Not long before the events of
