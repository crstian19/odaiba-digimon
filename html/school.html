                <p>Odaiba Shōgakkō is actually a fictional place, but its location is based on the beachside Koyo
                    Shōgakkō and Koyo Chuugakkō in Odaiba. Koyo opened in 1996 and is the only elementary school on the
                    island. The two schools are housed in adjoining buildings, along with a kindergarten, and share some
                    facilities. The nearest station is Odaiba-kaihinkōen Station.</p>

                <p>Odaiba Shōgakkō (Chuugakkō is never explicitly shown, lending to the possible idea of them sharing a
                    campus as the Koyo schools do) first appears in episode 35, <i>"Odaiba no Yōsei! Lilymon Kaika"</i>,
                    when Piyomon and Sora's mother go to the school soccer field. After that, it does not feature again
                    until <i>Digimon 02</i>, in the first episode and at various times after. At first glance, there
                    seems to be no similarities from the real Koyo Elementary and the fictional Odaiba Elementary.</p>

                <p>It's likely that since privacy is a big issue with schools, the name and exterior of the building
                    were deliberately made different. However, just before entering the Rainbow Bridge by car or
                    Yurikamome, a glimpse of the back courtyard of the school is visible:</p>

                        href="images/school_01_r.png"><IMG SRC="images/t_school_01_r.png" border=0></a></p>

                <p>As <i>"Odaiba no Yōsei! Lilymon Kaika"</i> was produced much earlier than <i>02's "Yūki o Uketsugu
                        Mono"</i> (episode 1), it's possible the school was initially meant to be a copy and that
                    decision was later changed, or there had been no intent to show the building from the front until
                    the second season went into planning, resulting in the change for privacy. The location can be
                    easily confirmed judging by the view of the beach and the Daibas in episode 13, <i>"Dagomon no
                        Yobigoe"</i>.</p>
