                <p>JR Shimbashi Station is located in a district of the same name on the mainland side of Tōkyō Bay. It
                    was the Tōkyō terminus of the first railway in Japan in 1872, the Tōkaidō Main Line, and was one of
                    the first railway stations built in Japan. Shimbashi remains a major railway hub to this day. </p>

                <p>The present-day structure opened in 1909 as Karasumori Station on the Yamanote Line. With the
                    extension of the Tōkaidō Main Line along its modern-day route to the new terminus at Tōkyō Station
                    in 1914, the original station was demolished. Japan's first subway line, operated by the Tōkyō
                    Underground Railroad Company, was extended to Shimbashi in 1934. In January 1939, the Tōkyō Rapid
                    Railway Company began to stop at Shimbashi on its line from Shibuya. The two would later merge to
                    form the Tōkyō Metro Ginza Line. The Toei Asakusa Line began service to Shimbashi in 1968, and the
                    elevated Yurikamome station opened in an adjacent building in 1995. It is the Tōkyō-side terminum
                    for the line. In 2003, a reconstruction of the original Shimbashi Station building and part of the
                    platforms was completed, which currently houses a railway history exhibit and a restaurant.</p>

                <p>As most of <i>Digimon Adventure</i> takes place on the Odaiba side of the bay, Shimbashi is only seen
                    briefly. In <i>"Odaiba no Yōsei! Lilymon Kaika"</i>, Jou and Gomamon are seen at the ticketing gate
                    in Yurikamome Shimbashi Station, as the trains are all cancelled. Later, Jou sits near the sculpture
                    outside the JR Shimbashi building, trying to decide what to do, before departing for Hinode instead.
