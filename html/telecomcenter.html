                <p>This is a major telecommunications hub between Tōkyō and the rest of the world. It boasts an
                    observation deck where you can see all of Odaiba and, on a good day, Mount Fuji as well. It was
                    completed in 1995 and, at that time, was intended to become the symbol of evolution on the
                    waterfront, which was then to be rebranded as Tōkyō Teleport Town. Access it from Telecom Center
                    Station.</p>

                <p>The Telecom Centre is a location that is only seen once, briefly, in <i>Digimon</i>, in a background
                    shot right after Taichi and Koromon arrive in episode 21, <i>"Koromon Tōkyō Daigekitotsu!"</i></p>
