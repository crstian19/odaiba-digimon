                <p>As early as 1985, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was intending to utilize the reclaimed land in
                    Tokyo Bay to create space that would help decentralize the busy city into many smaller subcentres.
                    In 1994, plans were laid for the futuristic area of Tōkyō Teleport Town, which would be made up of
                    four districts: Aomi, Ariake Minami, Ariake Kita and Daiba. The World Exposition Tokyo '96 was
                    planned to bring life to the area. However, when new governor Aoshima Yukio came to power in 1995,
                    the Expo was scrapped, and for a while there was concern that the reclaimed bay area was going to be
                    a huge financial dead zone after all. (Until this point Odaiba was entirely an industrial zone and
                    had only recently been rezoned.) Fortunately, even without the Expo's help, the area managed to
                    develop as a tourism and leisure spot. Aside from the Rinkai-sen's Tōkyō Teleport Station and the
                    Teleportation Bridge overpass that stretches from Odaiba-kaihinkōen to Palette Town, though, the
                    Tōkyō Teleport Town name didn't stick. </p>
                <p>Another consequence of the Expo cancellation was the slowdown of development in order to be more in
                    line with the then-unstable economy, and the permitting of more varied land uses for amusement
                    facilities. Odaiba's development period was extended another 10 years to compensate. Sometime prior
                    to 1998, the <i>Tōkyō Teleport Town</i> moniker was changed to <i>Rainbow Town</i>, a name which
                    does not yet appear to have worked out any better than the first. People continue to refer to the
                    area at large as simply "Odaiba."</p>
