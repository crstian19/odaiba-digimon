            <p>Tokyo Tower is a communications tower located in Shibakoen, Minato-ku. The 332.6-meter-tall orange and
                white lattice tower is the tallest self-supporting steel structure in the world, the tallest artificial
                structure in Japan and the 11th tallest tower in the world as of 2008. Built in 1958 to resemble the
                Eiffel Tower, it supports an antenna that broadcasts television and radio signals for media outlets such
                as NHK, TBS and Fuji TV. </p>

            <p>In addition to being a television and radio communications tower, Tokyo Tower functions as a major Tokyo
                tourist site. Over 2.5 million people annually visit the tower's recreational Foot Town and two
                observations decks. Foot Town is a 4-story building stationed directly under the tower which houses
                several museums, restaurants and shops. Departing from here, guests can also visit the two observation
                decks. The 2-story Main Observatory is located at 150 m, while the smaller Special Observatory is at 250
                m. The tower is constructed of steel, a third of which was from recycled World War II scrap steel. The
                observation decks offer an excellent view of the Rainbow Bridge, Fuji TV and the surrounding landscape
                (Daibakōen, Odaiba-kaihinkōen, Aqua City, DECKS Tokyo Beach), while on the opposite side of the bay the
                Fuji TV observation deck is an excellent vantage point to see Tokyo Tower from. Since it is mainly
                surrounded by low-rise buildings, Tokyo Tower can be seen from many other points in the central wards of
                Tokyo, such as Roppongi Hills, Odaiba/Tokyo Bay, the east gardens of the Imperial Palace, and the
                southern promenade of Shinjuku Station. </p>

            <p>From dusk to midnight, 176 floodlights completely illuminate the tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from
                October 2 to July 6 to cover the tower in an orange color. From July 7 to October 1, the lights are
                changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the
                change is seasonal: it is believed that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter
                months. Conversely, white is seen as a cool color and helps during the hot summer months. The Millennium
                Lighting was designed by Motoko Ishii and is occasionally changed to specific, unique arrangement for
                special events, such as blue, white and red for Christmas in past years, pink for National Breast Cancer
                Awareness Month, green for World Diabetes Day, and others. The seasonal lightings change by year and
                event and are often not re-used. Unfortunately, the planned opening of the taller Shin Tokyo Tower in
                2011 is expected to further depress Tokyo Tower's profits as broadcasters move to the new tower, so the
                future of the iconic tower is as of yet unknown. </p>

            <p>Just as the Eiffel Tower is often used in popular culture to immediately locate a scene in Paris, France,
                Tokyo Tower is often used in the same way to locate a scene in Tokyo. <i>Sailor Moon, Tenchi Muyo!,
                    Detective Conan, X, Card Captor Sakura</i> and <i>Magic Knight Rayearth</i> are just a few examples
                of shows that feature it. CLAMP is famous for utilizing the Tower in their works. The Tower is also
                frequently seen in the Japanese <i>kaiju</i> film genre, as the location of climatic battles between
                Godzilla, Mothra, and King Kong, as well as in more recent drama films like the aptly-titled <i>Tokyo
                    Tower</i> and <i>Always: San-chōme no Yūhi</i>. </p>

            <p>Tokyo Tower appears as a location twice in <i>Digimon,</i> first, in <i>Adventure's</i> "<i>Atsui ze
                    Tōkyō Tower! DeathMeramon</i>" when Sora and Mimi use the observation deck to search for the Eighth
                Child, but also for its air-conditioner. It is severely damaged in a fight between Birdramon,
                DeathMeramon, Kabuterimon and Greymon, and the area above the Main Observatory is almost severed
                entirely. In the <i>02</i> episode <i>"Odaiba Memoriaru"</i> (episode 17), Mimi and Sora revisit the
                Tower with Miyako, and recount the events that had happened three years before. </p>
