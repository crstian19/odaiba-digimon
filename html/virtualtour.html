                <p>If I could award the entire Internet to the person who created Google Street View, I would do it in a
                    heartbeat. While its implementation came along a smidge too late to be the indispensible resource
                    for my research that it could have been (that and the fact that I like doing it in the Real World),
                    it's great for those of you who are unable to go to Japan to get the full experience. As such, I
                    have charted out some major locations for you to visit in Odaiba! </p>

                <p>Just click and drag the image to operate the camera, and click the arrows to move along the street.

                <p>You are nearing the Daiba exit of Rainbow Bridge. Directly ahead of you, the road curves to the right
                    to enter the island. The Searea Ichibangai towers where Takeru, Iori and Miyako live are just beyond
                    that. If you turn to your right, you can see Odaiba on the other side of Tokyo Bay, and the
                    distinctive design of the Fuji Terebi building. In the foreground is the Dai-san Daiba, also known
                    as Daiba-koen, the park where the children commemorate Odaiba Memorial Day in an early episode of
                    <i>Digimon 02</i>. The squarish park, once a defensive battery protecting Tokyo from attack, is
                    hollowed out in the middle - this is where Imperialdramon launches from in episode 39. If you
                    continue to turn to 180 degrees from where you started, the bridge heads back to the Shinagawa side
                    of the Bay. Further around is the divider that separates the south side of the bridge from the north
                    side. The Yurikamome runs on the platform above you, but the pedestrian promenade that Miyako uses
                    to cross the bridge in <i>Diaboromon Strikes Back</i> is on the same level as you.

                <p>You are facing the convenience store, standing in the road. The overpass visible in the distance is
                    the Yurikamome rail. Turning right, the Gobangai apartments are visible. Directly behind your

                    the Digital World. Continuing in a cirle, you can see the shop Ogremon stood in front of. Above that
                    is the Searea Sanbangai Towers, between which the portal to the Digital World opened in the same

                    presumed to be Taichi's) are in sight. Turning in a circle, you can see down the road and DECKS in
                    the distance. Behind your original position is a treeline, behind which is the beach. Continuing to
                    circle, you can see the Shiria-mae crossing (the two towers are Searea Sanbangai) from the link

                    further to the right, just beyond the flower patch in the intersection, is the parking lot where the
