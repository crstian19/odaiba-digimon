                <p>Translating to "Dream Bridge," the Yume-no-Ohashi is a popular walkway, having a beautiful night view
                    and interesting architecture. It is a 360-meter pedestrian walkway that joins the Aomi area to
                    Ariake, lined with lampposts and benches. Walking on the Centre Promenade from Palette Town will
                    bring you to the bridge, which is inset with dozens of painted tiles depicting Japanese culture,
                    history, and random information about not just Odaiba but the Tōkyō area as a whole. From the
                    bridge, the ferris wheel can be seen making its colourful revolutions, and in the daytime from the
                    wheel the stylized design of the bridge is really noticible. Access it from Aomi station.</p>

                <p>The Yume-no-Ohashi is only glimpsed briefly in <i>Digimon Adventure</i>, as Phantomon lead the
                    hostages across it on their way to Tōkyō Big Sight in <i>"Odaiba no Yōsei! Lilymon Kaika."</i></p>
